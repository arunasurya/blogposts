# Bisq Blog Project

The aim of the Bisq blog project is to publish quality blog posts on [the Bisq blog](https://bisq.network/blog/) on a regular basis. Our posts will express diverse opinions and thoughts by writers with different backgrounds, from Bisq contributors and traders to writers outside the Bisq community. 

Anyone interested in contributing a post is welcome to join us! We are also open to those writers who want to write in a language other than English. The topics are not limited to Bisq only, and can include your thoughts on related subjects such as Bitcoin, privacy, cryptography, etc.

Although we are open to all enquiries, we cannot guarantee that we will publish all the posts. Posts that contribute new perspectives and ideas are best, while those that the blog editors feel don't add value to the Bisq blog may not be accepted. In order to avoid miscommunication, we suggest that you follow the steps in the blog writing process below.

The blog project is currently coordinated by two contributors, @arunasurya, who acts as [the project lead](blogprojectlead.md), and @m52go, who is involved in editing and publishing the posts.

## Blog writing process
If you are interested in contributing a post, please follow the steps below:
- Join the #blogposts channel on [the Bisq slack](https://bisq.slack.com/).
- Review [the blog writing schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1En6LwJQlzpsY5rOSuiZa2ThoI8rrdlTNoJK1ZlsIi38/edit#gid=0).
- Contact the project lead with your choice of the publishing week and the blog topic.
  - If you are not sure what you want to write about, no worries, we will help you figure this out.
- Once you know what you want to write about, you will be asked to write **a short abstract** and send it in a Google doc to the project lead. Please try to be as clear as possible and define the goal of the post.
- If the abstract is approved, you will be asked to write the first draft and share it with the project lead.
- The post will go through multiple reviews and edits by one or two editors before it is published on the [Bisq blog](https://bisq.network/blog/).
  - The blog editors will handle the editing and publishing process. All you need to focus on is writing.
- Once your post is published on the Bisq blog site, it will also appear in Medium's [bisq-network publication](https://medium.com/bisq-network).
  - If you are a regular Medium contributor, you can publish your post on your Medium site and submit it to the Bisq Medium publication. This is done **after** the post has been published on the Bisq blog.
  
## Bisq blog writers
- The writers are responsible for delivering quality blog posts by an agreed deadline.
- The writers are also encouraged to contribute to the Bisq writer community by sharing their ideas on blog topics, publicizing, etc.
- As a writer, you have the freedom to choose your own topic, the length of your post and the date of publication.

### Communication
Communication is done on slack, either directly with the project lead or on the #blogposts channel.

### Compensation
The blog writer can file a compensation request for the amount of BSQ that they think is reasonable for their work. 
The compensation request is filed **after** the blog post has been published on the Bisq blog site.


NOTE:
The blog writing process may evolve with time as we gain more experience. We welcome your input in improving the process!
