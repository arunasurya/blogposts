# Bisq Blog Project

The aim of the Bisq blog project is to publish quality blog posts on a regular basis. Our posts will express diverse opinions and thoughts by people in the Bisq community, including contributors and traders. 

## Writers
Anyone interested in contributing a post is welcome to join us! 

- The writers are responsible for delivering quality blog posts by an agreed deadline.
- The writers are also encouraged to contribute to the Bisq writer community by sharing their ideas on blog topics, publicizing, etc.
- As a writer, you have the freedom to choose your own topic, the length of your post and the date of publication.
- The topics are not limited to Bisq only, and can include your thoughts on related subjects such as Bitcoin, privacy, cryptography, etc.

### Communication
Communication is done on slack, either directly with the project lead or on the #blogposts channel.
The current project lead is @arunasurya.

### Compensation
The blog writer can file a compensation request for the amount of BSQ that they think is reasonable for their work. 
The compensation request is filed after the blog post has been published on the Bisq blog site.

## Blog writing process
If you are interested in contributing a post, we suggest that you do the following:
- Join our #blogposts slack channel.
- Review [the blog writing schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1En6LwJQlzpsY5rOSuiZa2ThoI8rrdlTNoJK1ZlsIi38/edit#gid=0).
- Contact the project lead with your choice of the publishing week and the blog topic.
  - If you are not sure what you want to write about, no worries, the project lead will help you figure this out.
- You will work closely with the project lead during the writing process, which consists of several steps:
  - Once you know what you want to write about, you will be asked to write the first draft and send it in a Google doc to the project lead.
  - The post will go through several reviews and edits before it is published on the [Bisq blog](https://bisq.network/blog/).
  - The project lead will handle the editing and publishing process. All you need to focus on is writing.
- Once your post is published on the Bisq blog site, it will also appear in the Bisq publication in Medium's [bisq-network publication](https://medium.com/bisq-network).
  - If you are a regular Medium contributor, you can publish your post on your Medium site and submit it to the Bisq Medium publication.

If you want to contribute future posts, you can discuss that with the project lead. You are welcome to create a series of posts with related topics.
